# Anri Lombard
This is the developer's first site using vue and scss

# Project Description
## What it does
This is the first site where the developer stopped trying to reinvent the wheel and used frameworks for better building.

## Tech used
Vue.js, SCSS

## Challenges and future features
- Adding animations, fades, and complex styling proved much harder than the developer thought. He understood what he did about 30% of the time when it worked, since the rest of the time was spent skrewing up.
- In future we could add more significant animations with libraries such as three.js or vr tech that Meta is working on.
