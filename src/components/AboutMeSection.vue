            Hey builder,
          </h3>
          <p style="font-size: 1.9rem; color: #423F3E; font-family: serif;">
            
            Anri here, I write research, solve math and statistic problems, and kick ass alongside Hermione (Ron wrote that). <br /> <br />
            My interests are solving problems in global warming, virtual education, and space colonisation;
            after my advanced wand-waiving degree. <br /> <br />
            I'm synonomous with books and studying (sorry girls, not rugby), and intrigued by all 4 people I met 
            this year; we'll connect easily if you know who Dobby is.
            <!-- Born and raised in Namibia, but now studying in South Africa. My childhood 
            was not filled with technology and programming, it was filled with people. 
            Caring, smart, hard-working people.<br /><br />
            Growing up to see them use their lives to do whatever gets them through the week 
            left a scar deep in my heart. -->
            <!-- I'm an 19 year old building projects full time in South Africa and
            have a ton of fun studying at the university of Cape Town on the
            side!<br /><br />I've been programming since I was 16, but my real
            passion has always been to learn quickly and put it to use. As a
            teenager I did this with drawing, running, modelling (yes), writing,
            mathematics, academics and smiling. Now I take it into my life's
            work of exploration, science, and engineering by following the same
            path I always have. -->

            I'm inspired by the perseverant and curios that change the world; I'm obnoxious to anyone who 
            watches television, and have a problem with Netflix bingers, unless it is Harry Potter. <br /> <br />
            I'm addicted to smiles, hugs and handshakes, and give them out mostly to mathematicians, 
            statiticians, novelists, engineers, and all wizards (Ok, most wizards). <br /> <br />
            You could follow me on <a href="#bottom">Twitter</a>, where I'll post my research and wizardry
            projects.
