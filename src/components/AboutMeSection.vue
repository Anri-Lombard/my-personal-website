            Hey builder,
          </h3>
          <p style="font-size: 1.9rem; color: #423F3E; font-family: serif;">
            I'm Anri. <br />
            Born and raised in Namibia, but now studying in South Africa. My childhood 
            was not filled with technology and programming, it was filled with people. 
            Caring, smart, hard-working people.<br /><br />
            Growing up to see them use their lives to do whatever gets them through the week 
            left a scar deep in my heart.
            <!-- I'm an 19 year old building projects full time in South Africa and
            have a ton of fun studying at the university of Cape Town on the
            side!<br /><br />I've been programming since I was 16, but my real
            passion has always been to learn quickly and put it to use. As a
            teenager I did this with drawing, running, modelling (yes), writing,
            mathematics, academics and smiling. Now I take it into my life's
            work of exploration, science, and engineering by following the same
            path I always have. -->

            They stopped dead learning the language of the future since their chances
            of excelling are slim. "There are Americans in Harvard doing those things."
            <br /><br />
            Yes, there are. This year almost led me to that same excuse. I am 
            without parents, without teachers, and all I have is this computer.
            By most likely failing physics after working harder than any student
            I know, one thing keeps popping back up.<br /><br />
            All I have is this computer.<br /><br />
            A Harvard student is a student. I am a student. The only goal before 
            I die is to make sure each of those people see the rewards they deserve, 
            stave off the false belief, and see technology not as punishing 
            but a means to expression, transformation, and power to any who 
            dares to love it.
